## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- **Icons for all sensor types** - Better visual identification in UI
  - Moisture sensors: `mdi:water-percent`
  - Temperature sensors: Use default temperature icon
  - Illuminance sensors: `mdi:brightness-5`
  - Rain sensors: `mdi:weather-rainy`
  - Raw payload sensors: `mdi:code-braces`
- **Recognized valve models** - HTV213FRF, HTV245FRF, HTV0540FRF now recognized (support pending payload data)
- **Debug documentation** - Added DEBUG_VALVE_PAYLOAD.md for users to help capture valve payload data

### Improved
- **Entity organization** - Raw payload sensors marked as diagnostic entities (disabled by default)
- **Better error messages** - Improved logging for unsupported devices with GitHub issue reporting instructions
